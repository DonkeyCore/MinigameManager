  # %display% - Display name of the player (may be nickname)

  # %name% - Name of the player (not nickname)
  title: "&e&lLobby %id%"
  # The rest of the scoreboard

  # Additional notes:
  # - There can be no duplicate lines due to how scoreboards work, so to implement multiple blank
  # lines, you can simply increase the number of spaces on the line (does not look different in Minecraft)
