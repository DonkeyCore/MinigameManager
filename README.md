# MinigameManager
Bukkit/Spigot API for minigames

This project is a **Work in progress**!

## About
This Bukkit/Spigot plugin is a manager that controls rotations of minigames; players can join the rotations to play through any minigame the server offers.

The plugin provides an API for creating minigames easily, without having to deal with the rotations themselves. This way, it is super easy to just make a minigame and put it into action.

Documentation can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/DonkeyCore/MinigameManagerDocs).
